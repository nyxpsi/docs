# Docs and Contributions

This repo will eventually contain the documentation for our networking project [nyxpsi](https://github.com/nyxpsi/nyxpsi). And will include contribution guidelines and other useful information.

This repo is built with astro and the original design was stolen (as all good developers do) from [Theo's T3 Docs](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/tree/main/www).
